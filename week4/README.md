# Week-4-deliverables


### I was able to resolve the problems with passing props to my Route and have put all my code in my original project, which can be found in these locations:

### React project is here: https://github.com/reswanson/my-react-project
### Heroku link is: https://rswanson-assignment1.herokuapp.com/


Additionally,  I cleaned up the compiler warnings in my code and have added console logging to show the different update steps that I have added to my code for this assignment, so please see Developer Tools -> Console for these messages.

My additional page is "/admin" which can be reached from the Admin link.

I am using CSS with some inline styles for my styling as we discussed in email.  I have some inline styling also in a few locations.
I really do need to consolidate and make my styling consistent across my whole application, but as I learn more I can work on that.
