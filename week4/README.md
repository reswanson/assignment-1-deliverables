# Week-4-deliverables


## I was able to resolve the problems with passing props to my Route and have put all my code in my original project, which can be found here:


### React project is here: https://github.com/reswanson/my-react-project
### Heroku link is: https://rswanson-assignment1.herokuapp.com/


Additionally,  I cleaned up the compiler warnings in my code and have added console logging to show the different update steps that I have added to my code for this assignment, so please reference the browser console in developer tools for logging messages related to this assignment.
