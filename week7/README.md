# Week-7-deliverables

## I was able to get my app working in Heroku as I had indicated in an earlier email.  
### I setup a sandbox MongoDB Atlas user for my project. The connection string is defined as an ENV in my Heroku project.

## I added an additional feature that includes the ability to DELETE a user from the DB.  This can be located on the ADMIN page where you can enter the ID of a user and it will remove it from the DB.  
## Also on the ADMIN page is a link that will display the current contents of my collection.  ( There would need to be more error handling/features to make it really useful ).


## Please find my project deliverables here:
### React project: https://github.com/reswanson/my-react-project
### Heroku link: https://rswanson-assignment1.herokuapp.com/
### Zip of my local MongoDB db directory is in this week7 folder.  ( I haven't used this for a few days).
### You had asked for a writeup concerning testing for the Week 7 assignment and that is in a Word doc in this directory as well.
