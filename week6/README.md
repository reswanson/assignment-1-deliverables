# Week-6-deliverables


## I wasnt able to get my app deployed to Heroku. So I am including a video of a demo showing the features that have been implemented locally.

### There seems to be many ways to deploy an app with an api server to Heroku and start scripts in npm to deal with, but I was unable to get anything working in time so I am submitting the code that I have with the video.



### I had sent you an mail about having to enter a credit card to get mongodb installed as an Add-on to my Heroku app, but since I was spending time trying to get deployments working, I didn't get far enough to worry about MongoDB in Heroku.



### React project is here: https://github.com/reswanson/my-react-project/tree/week6         
- ( week6 branch, I wasnt merging to master until I had it working)
     
### Heroku link is: https://rswanson-assignment1.herokuapp.com/ 
- ( This has last week's code as I rolled back what I had been trying to deploy. )
  
### Video where I demo what I have working locally: ( you will have to download it )

### Zip of my local MongoDB directory:   ( you will have to download it )
