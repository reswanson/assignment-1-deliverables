# Week-6-deliverables


## I wasnt able to get my app deployed in Heroku. So I am including a video of a demo showing the features that have been implemented locally.

### There seems to be many ways to deploy an app with an api server to Heroku, but I was unable to get anything working in time so I am submitting the code that I have with the video.



### I had sent you an mail about having to enter a credit card to get mongodb installed as an Add-on, and I was spending time on deployment so I didn't get that far to worry about MongoDO.




### React project is here: https://github.com/reswanson/my-react-project
### Heroku link is: https://rswanson-assignment1.herokuapp.com/

### Video where I demo what I have working locally.
### Zip of my local MongoDB directory.
